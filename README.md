# Next Word Prediction with LSTM Model

This Jupyter Notebook project demonstrates a pipeline for text processing, tokenization, and sequence generation using an LSTM-based deep learning model. The code handles text cleaning, tokenization, and sequence generation to train an LSTM model, which can then be used to generate text sequences.

## Overview

1. **Text Cleaning**: Removes unwanted characters like punctuation, HTML tags, URLs, and email addresses.
2. **Tokenization**: Splits text into tokens and creates sequences of a specified length.
3. **LSTM Model**: Builds and trains an LSTM-based model to learn patterns from the tokenized sequences.
4. **Text Generation**: Uses the trained model to generate new text sequences.

## Workflow

1. **Load Data**: Import your text data into the notebook.
2. **Normalization and Cleaning**: Apply a series of cleaning steps to remove unwanted elements from the text.
3. **Tokenization and Sequences**: Tokenize the cleaned text and create sequences of tokens.
4. **Model Training**: Build and train the LSTM model with the generated sequences.
5. **Text Generation**: Generate text sequences using the trained model.

## Project Components

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project is developed in a Jupyter notebook, facilitating step-by-step code execution and explanation.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, used to build and train the LSTM model.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend framework for deep learning operations.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text cleaning and tokenization.
- **tqdm**: Library for progress tracking during operations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python and required packages are installed. You can install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy nltk tqdm
3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter notebook and follow the code cells to run the text processing pipeline and train the LSTM model.
